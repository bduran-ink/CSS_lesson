                <p>
                    
                 I won't stop following you
Now help me pray for<br>
The death of everything new
Then we'll fly farther <br>
                
<br>
'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't mind<br>
<br>
We'll stop to rest on the moon
And we'll make a fire<br>
I'll steal a carcass for you
Then feed off the virus<br>
<br>
'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't mind<br>
'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't<br>
<br>
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)<br>
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)<br>
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)<br>
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)<br>
<br>
I see a red light in June
And I hear crying <br>
You turn newborn baby blue
Now we're all the virus<br>
<br>
'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't mind<br>
'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't<br>
<br>
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)<br>
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)<br>
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)<br>
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)<br>
